A Facade design pattern is a **structural concept** that helps reduce complexity between clients and subsystems by providing a higher-level interface known as a facade.

For instance, consider an e-commerce web application server that has subsystem services such as InventoryService, PaymentService, and ShippingService. If each client had access to each service, the subsystem classesâ€™ will be tightly coupled with the client. To decouple the two and reduce complexity, a facade class or interface can be introduced as a liaison between the two. Clients can be agnostic to the implementation of the subsystem and the subsystem can just concentrate on the implementation of its logic.

### Sample Code

**Domain**

```kotlin
data class Product(
  val productId : Int,
  val name : String,
)
```

**Client/Controller**

```kotlin
class Controller(
  val facade : OrderServiceFacade
){
  fun orderProduct(productId : Int) : Boolean {
    val isOrderComplete = facade.placeOrder(productId)
    return isOrderComplete
  }
}
```

**Facade**

```kotlin
interface OrderServiceFacade {
  fun placeOrder(productId : Int) : Boolean
}

class OrderServiceFacadeImpl(
  val inventoryService : InventoryService,
  val paymentService : PaymentService,
  val shippingService : ShippingService
) : OrderServiceFacade(){
  override fun placeOrder(productId : Int) : Boolean {
    return if(val product = inventoryService.isAvailable(productId)){
      val paymentConfirmed = paymentService.makePayment()
      if(paymentConfirmed){
        shippingService.shipProduct(product)
        true
      } else false
    } else false
  }
}
```

**Service/Subsystem**

```kotlin
class InventoryService {
  fun isAvailable (productId : Int) : Product {
    /* Check persistent data to see if inventory is available */
    return product
  }
}

class PaymentService {
  fun makePayment () : Boolean {
    /* Connect with payment such as payment gateway or in app purchase */
    return true / false
  }
}

class ShippingServicxe{
  fun shipProduct(product : Product) : Unit {
    /* connect with external shipment service to ship product */
  }
}
```
