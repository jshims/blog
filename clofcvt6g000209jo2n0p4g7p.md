### Problem

413 payload too large error occurred when users were trying to upload their images.

### Issue

Since our API server had a large enough limit to uploadable image sizes and had configured AWS Elastic Beanstalk nginx proxy server's configuration `client_max_body_size`, we did not know what the issue was.

### Solution

Check the (actual) `client_max_body_size` set on EC2 instances.

I did not have a clear solution in mind, however, knew that it had to be a configuration issue. After searching for a command to check the actual configuration set on our API servers EC2 instance I came across [a post on AWS knowledge center](https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/elastic-beanstalk-nginx-configuration).

```bash
$ sudo nginx -T | egrep -i "client_max_body_size"
```

By connecting to our team's EC2 instances on the AWS console, I found out that it was a configuration issue on our frontend.

### Implementation

Our frontend was deployed using nginx which had it's configuration. By changing it's nginx configuration (nginx.conf) and setting the `client_max_body_size` to an appropriate size, we fixed the issue.
